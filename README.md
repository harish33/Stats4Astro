# Stats4Astro
Lecture notes and example code for my Undergraduate Statistics course taught in the fall of 2024 (Sept to Nov)
The course consists of 4hr per week of lectures and 2-4hr per week of tutorials. It ran for 8 weeks. 
The students learn the theoretical concepts in the lectures and get hands-on implementation in the tutorials (mostly with python)
I am only posting the material from the lectures for the moment. I taught the concepts using many examples, often drawn from the world of astronomy. 
As such, I am also posting the python code that I used to numerically solve the astrophysical statistical problems posed in the notes. 

The best way for a student of statistics to benefit from this material is to read the notes first and then go into the code to peruse the implementation of the methods described in the notes. The code is poorly commented, but I will improve that as and when I find the time. Most of the figures in the notes are outputs of the code. 

The course was taught by Prof. Scott Trager before I took over. I did not alter the syllabus of the course much. So credit is due to Scott for the formulation of the syllabus. 
The recommended reading for the course was "Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial" by Silvia and Skilling, which I also retained from Scott's course. I did not use the material in the book to formulate my notes, so the notes stand apart. However, the selection of topics covered do have some influence from the topics in the book, so I credit it here.
